Ultimate Dragline Production Calculator Report

Step 0 – Selected Dragline
  OEM: Liebherr

Step 1 – Production Inputs
  Bucket capacity (BCM): 10.8
  Cycle time (sec): 54
  Bucket fill factor: 1.15
  Swell factor: 1.2
  Machine factor: 1.0
  Availability: 0.9
  Utilisation: 0.80
  Number of draglines: 1
  Hours per shift: 8
  Shifts per day: 3
  Working days per year: 240

  Production Outputs
    Hourly production: 715.39 m³/hr
    Per shift: 5723.14 m³
    Per day: 17169.41 m³
    Annual: 4120657.92 m³

  Formula: hourly = bucket × fill × swell × M × 3600 / cycle × availability × utilisation × number
  Concept: Multiply bucket capacity by fill factor and swell factor to convert from bank to loose volume, then adjust by machine factor and divide by cycle time. Scale by availability, utilisation and the number of units.

Step 2 – Cost of Ownership
  Unit cost: €5000000
  Life: 14 years
  Salvage value: €0
  IIT rate: 15%
  Discount rate: 10%
  Operators: 3 @ €600/month
  Helpers: 3 @ €400/month
  Power req: 70 kW/h @ €1/kWh
  Lube %: 30%
  Maintenance %: 20%
  Breakdown %: 2%

  Cost Outputs
    Annual ownership cost: €758928.57
    Annual operating cost: €731588.57
    Total annual cost: €1490517.14
    Cost per hour: €258.77
  Formula: depreciation=(cost-salvage)/life; AYI=((life+1)*cost + (life-1)*salvage)/(2*life); IIT=AYI×IIT%; ownership=depreciation+IIT; operating = manpower + power + lube + maintenance + breakdown; total=ownership+operating.
  Concept: Convert capital cost into annual depreciation and average investment, apply interest/insurance/tax, and sum with annual operating costs to obtain total cost per unit.

Step 3 – Project Economics
  Sets of dragline: 1
  EUR→INR rate: 100
  Density: 1.1 t/m³
  Stripping ratio: 7:1
  Basis: waste
  Ore price: €10/t
  Annual production: 4120657.92 m³

  Economics Outputs
    Total cost: €1490517.14 / yr
    Cost per m³: €0.36 | 36.17 INR
    Total tons: 4532723.71 t/yr
    Recoverable ore: 647531.96 t/yr
    Revenue: €6475319.59 / yr
    Estimated profit: €4984802.45 / yr
  Concept: Multiply annual cost by number of sets to get total cost. Divide by annual production for cost per m³. Convert volume to tonnage using density and stripping ratio. Estimate ore revenue and profit.
